# Backlog (Ctrl + Shift + V für VSCode Ansicht)


## Hardware
- think about additional backup for redundency

## Bugs
- Manchmal wird GP nicht übertragen auf Vizulization
- Not working without filtering for bad cells / JV plot



## Features
- plot style for PPPs

### GUI
- Rework tauc plot --> scheisse at all
- related to Julians comments: Latex integratio to the plots (-> easier integration to a thesis) - adjusting the size of strings, e.g. in a plot to make it usable to publications


### Parsers
- JV: differentiate between forward and backward scans instead of only having a first and a second scan and the user needs to know which is which
- MPP: add new file type (or generate script to convert new files to old file type) 


### Ploting ideas
